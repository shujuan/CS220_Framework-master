GR1 and GR2 Routers 

Notes:  

In order to compile the GR1, please type make gr1. 
Then execute ./routergr1 <jsonfile.json>

Because the GR2 is more difficult two test, we have hardcode two test cases 
as suggested in the paper.  

First test case 

To compile the first test case, please type make gr2.
To execute, type ./routergr2   

This command will execute the gr2 with one of the gr2 test 
cases (testcase00gr2.json) in the directory testcases  

Second test case  

To compile the first test case, type make gr22.
To execute, type ./routergr22    
 
This command will execute the gr2 with one of the gr2 test 
cases (testcase02gr2.json) in the directory testcases.
